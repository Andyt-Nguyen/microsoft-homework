# microsoft-homework

A free education website that microsoft offers new Web-Dev people. Here is a little project they made us build which is very simple and for one to keep for his/her self. Using languages and frameworks such as Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and JS. This helps people such as myself to keep code clean.

In the course they touch very lightly on Angular, Jquery, SASS, SCSS, and Typescript.
